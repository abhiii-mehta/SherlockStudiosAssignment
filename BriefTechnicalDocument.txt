FPS Inventory + Exploration Task (HDRP) – Implementation Overview


Project Summary

This Unity HDRP project is a first-person exploration game featuring an inventory 
and flashlight system as per the assignment requirements. The player can collect 
and use items, including a rechargeable flashlight with battery management and UI feedback.

Due to a personal emergency, I was unable to complete all aspects of the assignment 
within the deadline. However, I made every effort to manage my time and implement 
the core systems to demonstrate my understanding and skills.


Systems Implemented

1. Flashlight System
   - Toggle On/Off: Player can toggle flashlight on or off using a key (default F).
   - Battery Drain: Battery drains over time when flashlight is on, with adjustable drain rate.
   - Battery Recharge: Player can recharge the flashlight battery by using collected battery items from inventory.
   - Light Intensity Dimming: The flashlight’s light intensity gradually decreases as the battery drains.
   - Fallback Ambient Light: When the flashlight battery is depleted, a dim fallback light flickers to provide minimal visibility.
   - UI Battery Bar: A slider UI bar displays the current battery level in real-time.
   - Battery Drain Pause: Battery drainage pauses when the inventory UI is open to prevent unintended battery loss.

2. Inventory & Interaction System
   - Inventory Toggle: Inventory UI is opened and closed using the Tab key.
   - Collectible Items: Items (batteries and others) can be picked up using a key prompt (E).
   - Inventory Management: Batteries are tracked with a count and shown in the inventory UI.
   - Use Battery Item: Players can use batteries from the inventory to recharge the flashlight.
   - UI Elements: Includes battery count text and a button to use batteries.
   - Button Visibility: The "Use Battery" button only appears if the player has batteries and is not inspecting another object.
   - Inspect System: Players can inspect items, rotating and zooming them at a fixed inspection spot.
   - Cancel Inspection: Inspection can be cancelled with a button, returning the item to its original position.


Design Decisions

- Flashlight Battery Management: Implemented a realistic battery drain rate adjustable for gameplay pacing. Rechargeable batteries encourage exploration and resource management.
- UI Integration: Battery bar and inventory buttons provide intuitive player feedback without cluttering the screen.
- Player Controls During Inspection: Player movement and camera look are disabled during inspection to focus on the item, while allowing smooth mouse-driven rotation and zoom of the inspected object.
- Fallback Light Flicker: Flickering fallback light adds atmosphere and signals low battery without full darkness.
- Inventory System Scope: Focused on battery items to meet core requirements; can be extended for other usable/pickupable items.
- Simplified Item Interaction: Pickup and inspection use simple trigger zones and keypress, avoiding complex UI until the inventory is accessed.


How to Use

- Flashlight: Toggle on/off with F. Battery drains while on.
- Collect Batteries: Approach battery pickups and press E to collect.
- Inventory: Open/close inventory with Tab. Use the inventory UI to see battery count and use batteries to recharge flashlight.
- Inspect Items: Trigger inspection on applicable items; rotate with mouse movement and zoom with scroll.
- Cancel Inspection: Click the cancel button to stop inspecting and return item to original place.
